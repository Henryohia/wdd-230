          How do people decide whether certain elements are part of a larger
          group or not? They look at objects, and if objects are located close
          to one another, they see them as a unit. Take a look at the image
          above. You will likely see two groups of elements rather than eighteen
          individual objects. All objects are identical, and the only thing
          differentiating them is the white space that separates them. People
          follow the same approach when they interact with both physical and
          digital products. For example, when we examine a web page or mobile
          screen, we usually see it as a composition of objects rather than
          individual objects. This perception offers user interface (UI)
          designers an excellent opportunityâ€”as it is possible to group objects
          together that share similar functionality or properties.

        <h1>Contrast</h1>

        <p>
          Contrast is the relationship between two or more design elements whose
          dramatic differences are emphasized when both elements are shown
          together. The degree of contrast between these elements is
          disproportionate to their level of similarity: the less similar two
          items are, the greater the contrast between them. The most effective
          way to use contrast in web design is by familiarizing yourself with
          the many types of contrast that can exist. Once you have covered this
          baseline, you can intuitively apply sophisticated forms of contrast to
          your designs.

        <h1>Visual Hierarchy</h1>

          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          Visual Hierarchy is used to rank design elements and influence in the
          order you want your users to view them. By using principles like
          contrast, scale, balance and, more, you can help establish each
          element in its rightful place and help the most important elements
          stand out. Pictured above, Avioc utilizes symmetry on its homepage to
          bring focus to their key strengths while offering a broader summary on
          each side of the image. The focal point is directly in the center, yet
          it is still easy to glance around the page to find more information
          without feeling lost.
